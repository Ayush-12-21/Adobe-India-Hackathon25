There are, for example, enormous differences in the financial resources available to libraries mandated to provide similar services. Some post-secondary and public libraries, particularly those in large urban areas, have the facilities, funding and technological infrastructure necessary to service their patrons with electronic services and resources.  Many others, particularly in rural regions, do not. The proposal must indicate how these issues will be approached. Milestones 1) A preliminary report will be issued during June 2003.",
